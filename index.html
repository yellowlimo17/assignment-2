      instructions for completing the short problems below, but it also will
      hold your completed answer inside boxes with rounded corners. When answer
      is not provided these boxes are display with
      <span class="incorrect">red border</span>. After your JavaScript code
      produces the expected answer, the border should turn

    <p>
      As a Java programmer, sometimes you have to look up relevant information
      from the
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java Online API</a>
      page to learn more detailed information on commonly used Java classes such
      as String, ArrayList, System, Random, Scanner, etc. JavaScript developers
      have access to equally extensive online documentations. In particular, the
      JavaScript classes and functions for manipulating HTML documents are
      collectively known as the
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model"
        >DOM APIs</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this assignment the relevant documentations are the DOM interfaces
      listed below:

    <p>
      At the top of each documentation page, you'll find shortcut links to
      various subsections. Most of the time you'll want to browse the "Methods"
      subsection.

    </div>

    <h2>Sample Code</h2>
    <p>
      As a warm-up, the JS file shows a few commented lines to show you a short
      sample program how to manipulate DOM tree from using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Make the following changes to <code>jsdom.js</code></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Define a variable <code>myname</code> and initialize it with your full
        name
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncomment the commented lines for part0 and reload the browser.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>(2 pts)</h3>
    <div id="part00" class="result"></div>

    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>
      You have access to both the CSS (<code>instructorstyle.css</code>) and JS
      file (<code>verify.js</code>) which are bundled as part of the assignment
      package. Refer to these two files for your reference and JS examples.
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging</h2>
    <p>
      This is perhaps the best time to start using the builtin browser debugger
      explained in class at the beginning of the semester.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the browser DevTools</li>
      <li>
        Switch to the "Source" tab, the left-side panel should show the list of
        HTML, CSS, and JS files loaded by your browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select <code>jsdom.js</code> to start debugging your JavaScript program.
        The following screenshot shows Chrome DevTools <b>after</b> a breakpoint
        is set at line 16 of your program and the page is <b>reloaded</b>.
        Breakpoints can be added/removed by clicking the line numbers.

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="Debugger.png" width="640" />
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are six important components in the debugger panel</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Step Over</b>: Continue to the next line after the current statement
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step Into</b> Function: if the next line is a function call, trace
        the execution inside that function
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Step Out</b>: Resume the current function and return to its caller
      </li>
      <li>
        The leftmost button (to the left of "Step Over") has dual purposes:
        <b>Pause</b> or <b>Resume</b> debugging
      </li>
      <li>
        The "Scope" tab where you can inspect all the variables used by your
        program
      </li>
      <li>
        The "Console" tab (lower right) where all the
        <code>console.log()</code> output will be displayed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      Be sure you are aware that <code>console.log()</code> does not send its
      output to the browser "canvas", and it is mainly used for "debugging"
      purposes during development. On a real production release, your JS code
      should be free of any <code>console.xxx()</code> statements.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Injecting Intentional Bugs</h3>
    <p>
      To let you practice using the Debugger, make the following changes in
      <code>jsdom.js</code> and be sure to keep the DevTools open. (The
      following instructions assumes you are using Chrome).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Change the spelling of the first call to
        <code>createTextNode</code> inside the if-statement to
        <code>createTextNote()</code> then reload the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Look at the console output (below the list of variables) and inspect the
        detailed output that gives you hints which line(s) of your JS file is
        causing the error.
      </li>
      <li>Revert your JS code to undo the above bug.</li>
      <li>
        Now try injecting a different bug but with additional breakpoints set.
        Replace <code>zero.appendChild(boldNode)</code> to
        <code>zero.appendChild(boldNod)</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a <b>breakpoint</b> on the line and also at the if-statement above
        it. Reload the page. You program should be suspended at the
        if-statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hover your mouse over the the misspelled variable name, and also try to
        hover your mouse over other variable names. Notice how you can inspect
        detailed information on each variable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hit either the "Step Over" or "Resume" button to continue running your
        program to the next line or next breakpoint.
      </li>
      <li>Revert your code to undo the above bug</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Use the above techniques for debugging your code while completing this
      assignment (as well as other future ones)
    </p>

    <h2>(5 pts) Part 1: Display Array as a List</h2>
    <p>
      The JS starter file declares an array of strings: <code>atoms</code>. Add
      necessary JS code to display these atom names in a numbered list.
    </p>
    <div id="part01" class="result"></div>

    <h2>(5 pts) Part 2: Display Information in an Object</h2>

    Use the <code>const</code> keyword to declare two objects that describes
    personal travels. Each object should have the following three
    properties/keys:

    <table id="travel">
      <tr>
        <th>Key/Prop</th>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Example</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>destination</code></td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>Name of the place you visited (or want to visit)</td>
        <td>Orlando, Florida</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>dateOfVisit</code></td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>When visited</td>
        <td>March 2017</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>isAbroad</code></td>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td>Is it domestic or international?</td>
        <td>false</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The JS starter file already declare two variables:
      <code>myDomesticTravel</code> and <code>myInternationalTravel</code>.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Make necessary changes to these variable to add the three properties
        above, but don't change their name
      </li>
      <li>
        For each travel, create a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) containing a short
        sentence that includes both the <code>destination</code> and
        <code>dateOfVisit</code> properties. For example, the sentence in your
        paragraph may look something like:
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I had fun this March 2017 spending time with family in Orlando,
            Florida.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mom is so generous to pay for my air ticket to Orlando, Florida
            in March 2017.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Explore the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList"
          >Element::classList</a
        >
        property to add a class name ("domestic" or "international") to each of
        the paragraph created.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create your own CSS file (do not modify
        <code>instructorstyle.css</code>) to define these two classes, and apply
        different style of each. Remember to link you
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div id="part02" class="result"></div>

    <h3>(2 pts) Extra credit</h3>
    Add a new property to your object, <code>photoURL</code> that points either
    to a local image or a remote image somewhere on the internet. Explore how to
    use the function
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute"
      >Element::setAttribute()</a
    >
    to set the <code>src</code> attribute to your photo. Show the images in
    addition to the sentences above.

    <h2>(7 pts) Part 3: Array of objects</h2>
    <p>
      In this part, your JS code will be handling an array of objects. The
      concept is pretty much similar to Java arrays (not Java ArrayList). Let's
      say you have an array of two items:
    </p>
    <pre>
    const months = [
      {name: "January", days: 31},    
      {name: "February", days: 28}
    ];

    console.log(months[0].name); // Output: January
    console.log(months[0].days); // Output: 31
    </pre>
    <p>
      Given an array of objects
      <code>atomObjects</code>,:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a numbered list of atom name and its weight. The completed HTML
        should look approximately like the following (except for randomized
        order)

        <ol>
          <li>Aluminum (weight: 26.982)</li>
          <li>Barium (weight: 137.33)</li>
          <li><i>...many more...</i></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Define two classes in your CSS: "light" and "heavy". Apply the "heavy"
        class to atoms whose weight is above 150. Apply different text colors to
        each class:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use the <a href="http://hslpicker.com">HSL color space</a> to define
            the colors
          </li>
          <li>The two colors should share the same Hue and Saturation</li>
          <li>
            The "light" class should use a higher Luminance and the "heavy"
            class should use a lower luminance. Be sure to use
            <b>non-zero</b> luminance, otherwise the color turns black.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Extra Credits</b>: Explore how to print the weight to show only one
        decimal place so the output will look like
        <ol>
          <li>Aluminum (weight: 27.0)</li>
          <li>Barium (weight: 137.3)</li>
          <li><i>...many more...</i></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div id="part03" class="result"></div>

    <h2>(9 pts) Part 4: Table</h2>
    <p>
      Show the atoms in the array <code>atomObjects</code> used in Part 3 in a
      two-column table.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The table must be constructed using these tags: &lt;table&gt;,
        &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;td&gt;. You may also use &lt;thead&lt; and
        &lt;tbody&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        The header row of the table should show title texts "Atom" and "Weight"
      </li>
      <li>
        The remaining data rows show the atom name and weight (number only)
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply the same "heavy" and "light" classes from the previous part to
        table rows holding heavy atom or light atom, respectively. Add necessary
        CSS definition(s) so rows containing heavy atoms have darker background
        and lighter atoms have lighter background. Hint: use HSL color space.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The general structure of your table should look like the following (except
      for styles)
    </p>
    <div id="sampleAtomTable">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Atom</th>
          <th>Weight</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Aluminum</td>
          <td>26.982</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Oxygen</td>
          <td>15.999</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">...more data...</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <div id="part04" class="result"></div>

    <h2>(Extra Credit: 5 pts) Part 5: Grid Layout</h2>
    <p>
      Repeat Part 4, but use CSS Grid layout in place of a physical table. This
      means, your JS code should not generate &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;,
      &lt;th&gt;, &lt;td&gt; elements. Hint:
      <i
        >The JS code for this part should be shorter compared to Part 4.
        However, you have to write more CSS declarations.</i
      >
    </p>

    <div id="part05" class="result"></div>

    <script src="jsdom.js"></script>
    <script src="verify.js"></script>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Upload all the files included the assignment bundle to a publicly
        accessible web host (EOS or elsewhere)
      </li>
